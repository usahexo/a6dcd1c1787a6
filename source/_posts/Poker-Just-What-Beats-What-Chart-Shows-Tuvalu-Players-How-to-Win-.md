#  Poker Statistics Released: Which Hands Win the Most 

The world of poker is a complex one, with a plethora of statistics and data that can be analyzed to help players improve their game. However, some of the most important information for players is which hands win the most often.

To begin, let’s take a look at pocket pairs. These hands are those where you are dealt two cards of the same rank, such as two kings or two queens. While many novices might think that all pocket pairs are created equal, this is far from the truth. In fact, the hand with the highest chance of winning is two aces – in fact, it wins around 31 percent of the time!

After aces, things get a bit more complicated. The second-highest winning hand is two kings, which wins about 27 percent of the time. From there, things get progressively worse – two queens only has a winning percentage of about 24 percent, and two jacks only has a 20 percent chance of winning. Finally, the worst pocket pair to have is two eights, which only has a 12 percent chance of winning.

If you’re looking to set your sights on a specific hand in order to improve your chances of winning, these are the ones to pay attention to. Keep in mind that this information should not be used as an excuse to play recklessly; rather, it should be used as a tool to help you make better decisions when it comes to which hands to play and when. After all, even with the best hand possible there’s still always some risk involved in playing poker!

#  Winning Hands in Poker: What You Need to Know Now 

In a game of poker, the strength of your hand is everything. You need to know which hands are playable and how to play them if you want to win.

Here is a list of the winning hands in poker, from weakest to strongest:

One Pair (e.g., two queens) 
Two Pair (e.g., two aces and two kings) 
Three of a Kind (e.g., three sixes) 
Straight (e.g., five through nine) 
Flush (five cards of the same suit) 
Full House (three of a kind plus a pair) 
Four of a Kind (four of the same number or rank) 
Straight Flush (five consecutive cards of the same suit) 
Royal Flush (an Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and 10 all from the same suit)

#  Study Shows Which Hands Win More Often in Poker Tournaments 

A recent study found that some hands are more successful at winning poker tournaments than others. The study, which was conducted by two professors at the University of Alberta, looked at over three million hands of tournament poker played by both amateurs and professionals.

The research found that pocket aces, king-queen suited, and king-jack suited are the most successful hands in tournaments, with each winning around 33% of the time. In contrast, pocket jacks and 10-7 suited were the least successful hands, winning only 13% of the time.

The research also found that there is a significant difference between the performance of amateurs and professionals. Pocket aces were the most successful hand for both groups, but while amateurs won with them 34% of the time, professionals won an impressive 43% of the time.

So what can you learn from these findings? Well, if you’re playing in a tournament, it might be worth considering adopting a tight strategy and playing conservatively with strong hands like aces and kings. And if you find yourself dealt one of the less successful hands, remember that it’s not necessarily game over – you can still win if you play smartly.

#  New Poker Odds Chart Released - See What Beats What!

The poker odds chart is an extremely useful tool for any player looking to improve his or her game. But, as with all tools, it's important to understand how to use it properly in order to get the most out of it.

The first thing you'll need to know is the order of poker hands. This is fairly straightforward - the higher the hand, the better. Here is the list, from worst to best:

High card

Pair

Two pair

Three of a kind

Straight

Flush

Full house

Four of a kind

Straight flush 



























    Ace high straight flush (highest hand)  So now that you know the order of poker hands, let's take a look at how to use the odds chart. The first column on the chart shows you what your odds are of being dealt each type of hand. For example, if you're playing Texas hold'em and are dealt two kings preflop ( pocket kings ), your odds of hitting a king on the flop are 1 in 13. This means that if you were to play 13 hands, statistically speaking, you would hit a king once. The second column tells you what your odds are of making your hand given that you already have certain cards in play. Continuing with our example, if you are already holding two kings and the flop comes up Ace-2-3 , your odds of making a three of a kind increase from 1 in 13 to 1 in 4 . The last column tells you what your odds are of losing should you decide to showdown . So, for instance, if you have Pocket Aces and someone else has Pocket Queens , your odds of losing are 2 in 3 .
