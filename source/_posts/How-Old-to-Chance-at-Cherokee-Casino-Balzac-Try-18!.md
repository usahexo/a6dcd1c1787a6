#  New Casino Opening in Balzac – Minimum Age Set at 18 Years

The opening of a new casino in Balzac has caused some controversy, as the minimum age for entry has been set at 18 years. This is a year below the provincial minimum age of 19 years.

Opponents of the casino say that it is exploiting young people and encouraging gambling addiction. However, proponents argue that 18-year-olds are adults and should be allowed to make their own decisions. They also point out that there are already many casinos in Alberta where the minimum age is 19 years or older.

The head of the Balzac casino says that it will be a responsible operator and will take measures to prevent problem gambling. She also points out that there are many other activities available for young people, such as movies, restaurants, and shopping.

The new casino is expected to create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue to the town of Balzac.

#  You Have To Be 18 To Gamble At The New Cherokee Casino In Balzac

It is now illegal for minors to gamble at the brand new Cherokee Casino in Balzac. The province has been cracking down on gambling establishments and has set the legal age to 18 years old in order to gamble.

The casino is operated by the Stoney Nakoda Nation and it is their second location in the province. The first one is located in Morley, just west of Calgary. The new casino has been open for just over a month and it features 900 slot machines, blackjack, roulette, poker and bingo. There is also a 8,000 square foot event center that can accommodate up to 1,000 people.

There are other casinos located in Alberta, but they are all owned by the province’s two largest gaming companies, Millenium Casino Resort and Casino Edmonton. Both of those casinos are located in Edmonton. The minimum legal gambling age at those two casinos is 19 years old.

Many people are not happy with the new law, including some of the employees at the Cherokee Casino in Balzac. They argue that it will keep many young people from spending their money at the casino.

#  Cherokee Casino In Balzac Officially Opens – Minimum Age 18

The Cherokee Casino in Balzac has been open for a few weeks now, and the minimum age to gamble has been raised from 18 to 21. The casino is in the central part of the province, not far from Calgary.

The decision to raise the minimum age to gamble was made by the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission (AGLC). The commission said that it made the decision after it did a study that showed that Albertans who are 18 to 21 are more likely to have problems with gambling than those who are older.

The commission also said that it would be doing more research on the matter. It’s not clear yet what this research will entail, or when it will be completed.

In a statement, Director of Communications with AGLC, Tim Cusack, said that “The AGLC is always looking at ways to protect customers and enhance public safety. In light of new research on problem gambling behaviour among 18-21 year olds, we have raised the minimum age for casino entrances to 21 years old province-wide.”

Opponents of the change say that it’s discriminatory against young people and that it won’t do anything to address problem gambling behaviours. They also argue that many young people who are 18 or 19 are responsible enough to gamble responsibly.

Cherokee Casino President Tony Tanner said in a statement that his casino is committed to responsible gaming and welcomes all guests aged 18 and older. He added that the casino has many options for those who want to gamble responsibly, including self-exclusion programs and limits on how much money they can spend while they’re there.
