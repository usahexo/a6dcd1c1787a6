#  What is the most popular Virtual Racing app?

A racing game is a type of video game where the player controls a vehicle to compete in a race. Racing games can be divided into two categories: arcade games and simulation games.

Arcade games usually have less realistic physics, and are more about the player’s skill in making quick decisions and maneuvers. Simulation games, on the other hand, attempt to replicate the experience of driving a real-life car, with more accurate physics and vehicle dynamics. Racing simulators are sometimes used by race drivers to practice for real races.

Virtual reality (VR) is an interactive computer-generated experience taking place within a simulated environment. It incorporates mainly auditory and visual feedback, but may also allow other types of interaction such as haptic feedback. In 2016, VR was designated by the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) as an official gaming sector.[1] Virtual reality applications may include simulated tourism or education.

The most popular Virtual Racing app is RaceRoom Racing Experience (R3E), which released in 2013 as a free-to-play title on Steam.[2] The game has seen over 7 million downloads, with a peak concurrent users count of over 125,000 in February 2018.[3][4] In R3E, players race against AI opponents or online players in various real and fictional racing scenarios. The game features 63 different cars and 18 tracks, with additional content regularly added by the developers.[5]
