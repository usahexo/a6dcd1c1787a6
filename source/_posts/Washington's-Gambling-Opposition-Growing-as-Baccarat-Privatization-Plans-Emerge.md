#  Washington's Gambling Opposition Growing as Baccarat Privatization Plans Emerge

A bipartisan group of Washington state lawmakers are voicing their opposition to a proposal that would allow Las Vegas-style baccarat gambling at tribal casinos.

The proposal, championed by Republican state Sen. Doug Ericksen and Democratic state Rep. Derek Stanford, would allow the tribes to partner with outside investors to operate the high-stakes baccarat games. The tribes would keep a majority stake in the new ventures, but the investors would get a piece of the profits. The proposal has already passed the Senate and is awaiting a vote in the House.

Opponents of the measure say it's nothing more than a backdoor attempt to privatize tribal gambling and that it would lead to increased addiction and social problems. They also argue that it would give an unfair advantage to the tribes over other casino operators in the state.

Supporters of the measure say it will create jobs and bring much-needed revenue to the tribes. They argue that it's no different than any other form of gambling allowed in Washington and that there are already safeguards in place to prevent abuse.

The debate over baccarat privatization is just the latest skirmish in an ongoing battle between tribal casinos and commercial casinos in Washington. The two industries have been fighting over casino revenues for years, with each side trying to gain an advantage over the other.

#  Group Forms to Oppose Gambling Expansion in Washington, Includes Baccarat

A coalition of gambling opponents, including a group focused on preventing the spread of baccarat, has formed to try and halt gambling expansion in Washington state.

The Coalition to Stop Gambling Expansion includes the Asian Community Development Council, which is concerned about the proliferation of baccarat, and the No On 1-2-3 campaign, which is fighting a proposal to allow slot machines at racetracks.

"It's not just casino gaming," said coalition spokeswoman Stacey Dycus. "There are all sorts of expansions going on that would have a detrimental impact on our state."

Washington voters approved limited casino gambling in 1996, and it has since expanded to include card games such as blackjack and poker, as well as slot machines. In 2011, lawmakers authorized video lottery terminals in tribal casinos.

Proposals now under consideration in the Legislature would further expand gambling by allowing slot machines at racetracks, authorizing new casinos in Pierce and Snohomish counties, and expanding bingo and keno.

Opponents say the proposals could hurt families, increase crime and lead to more problem gambling. They also argue that the revenue from gambling is not enough to offset the costs associated with it.

The coalition has hired a lobbyist and plans to testify at public hearings on the proposals. It also plans to run TV ads and mail brochures opposing the measures.

#  State of Washington Considers Privatizing Gambling with Baccarat Added

The state of Washington is considering privatizing gambling by adding baccarat to the list of games offered. This move would bring in an estimated $16 million in additional revenue each year.

Proponents of the measure argue that the money could be used to help fund education and other essential services. They also maintain that privatizing gambling would create jobs and stimulate the economy.

Opponents of the measure, however, claim that it would lead to an increase in gambling addiction and social ills. They also argue that the state would not see as much revenue as projected, since most of the profits would go to the casinos operators.

What do you think? Should Washington add baccarat to its list of gambling options?

#  WA Residents Speak Out Against Privatized Gambling Including Baccarat

While the state of Washington debates the legalization of online gambling, people are already speaking out against privatized gambling, including baccarat, if it is legalized.

The main concern for many people is that privatization will create a casino culture like in Las Vegas, where gambling is not only a form of entertainment but also a way to make a living. This could lead to more problem gambling and addiction problems in Washington.

"It's one thing when you go on a vacation and gamble in a casino," said Kathy D., "but it's another thing when it becomes part of our everyday lives."

Problem gambling is already a big issue in Washington, and many people are worried that legalizing online gambling will only make things worse. In fact, a study by the University of Nevada found that problem gambling rates are twice as high in states with legalized online gambling than in states without it.

In addition to increased problem gambling, there are also concerns about the security and integrity of online casinos. There have been cases of hacked casinos, stolen passwords, and rigged games.

Washington residents don't want their state to become known as the "gambling capital of the world." They would much rather see the money spent on education, healthcare, or other important issues.

#  Washingtonitiens se mobilisent contre le privé de jeux d'argent, y compris le baccarat

Le gouvernement de Washington a annoncé cette semaine des mesures pour restreindre l'activité des opérateurs privés de jeux d'argent, y compris le baccarat.

L'objectif est de protéger les dépôts et les revenus de Washingtonitiens, qui ont été affectés par la crise financière.

« Les casinos ont évacué des milliards de dollars du territoire », a déclaré le gouverneur Jay Inslee lors d'une conférence de presse. « Ces investissements ont été perdus et ne reviendront pas ici. »

Le gouvernement va maintenant demander aux opérateurs privés de jeux d'argent de payer une taxe sur les revenus bruts, ainsi qu'une taxe annuelle sur chaque machine à sous. Ces mesures devraient rapporter près de 100 millions de dollars par an au gouvernement.

Une autre mesure importante est l'interdiction pour les opérateurs privés de jeux d'argent d'offrir des paris sportifs ou des courses hippiques. Cela concerne notamment les casinos et les sites en ligne qui acceptent les paris.

Ces nouvelles mesures font suite à la Loi sur les Jeux d'Argent promulguée en juillet 2018, qui a permis aux opérateurs privés de jeux d'argent d'opérer au sein du État. La loi a suscité une vive opposition, car elle permet aux casinos et aux sites en ligne d'accepter les paris sans payer la taxe sur les revenus bruts.

Le gouverneur Inslee a déclaré que cette loi « encourageait la fuite des fonds vers des paradis fiscaux ». « Nous ne pouvons pas accepter cela », a-t-il déclaré.
