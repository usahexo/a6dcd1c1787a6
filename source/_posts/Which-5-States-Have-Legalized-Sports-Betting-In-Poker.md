#  Which 5 States Have Legalized Sports Betting In Poker?

In May of 2018, the United States Supreme Court struck down the law that prohibited most forms of sports betting outside of Nevada. As a result, individual states have been working to pass their own laws regulating and taxing sports betting.

So far, five states have legalized some form of sports betting: Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. In this article, we'll take a look at each of these states and their sports betting laws.

Delaware was the first state to legalize sports betting after the Supreme Court's decision. The state's law allows for parlay betting on professional and college sporting events. Parlay bets are a type of bet where you need to pick multiple winners in order to win.

Mississippi was the second state to legalize sports betting. Under Mississippi's law, any person 21 or older can bet on sporting events at one of the state's licensed casinos. The state has also allowed internet and mobile betting.

New Jersey was the third state to legalize sports betting. New Jersey's law allows for bets on professional and college sporting events, as well as other types of wagers such as prop bets and futures bets. The state has also allowed internet and mobile betting.

Pennsylvania was the fourth state to legalize sports betting. Pennsylvania's law allows for bets on professional sporting events only. The law does not allow for bets on college sporting events or other types of wagers such as prop bets or futures bets. However, the state plans to add those options soon. Pennsylvania has also allowed internet and mobile betting.

West Virginia was the fifth state to legalize sports betting. West Virginia's law allows for bets on professional and college sporting events, as well as other types of wagers such as prop bets and futures bets. The state has also allowed internet and mobile betting

#  New Jersey, Nevada, Delaware, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania Are The 5 States That Have Legalized Sports Betting In Poker

The landscape of legalized sports betting in the United States has been shifting rapidly in recent months, with a flurry of activity at the state level. As of May 2018, five states had legalized some form of sports betting: New Jersey, Nevada, Delaware, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania.

This number is likely to grow in the months and years ahead, as more states move to capitalize on the potentially lucrative new market. The key question for interested parties – including both those who want to bet on sports and those who want to offer sports betting – is where things will stand in terms of legality and compliance come the start of the NFL season in September.

Here’s a rundown of where things currently stand with legal sports betting in each of the five states that have approved it thus far:

New Jersey: In New Jersey, sports betting has been legal since June 2017, when the state’s Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on the activity. Since then, Monmouth Park Racetrack has been up and running as one of the first legal sportsbooks in the country. The major leagues (MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL) are all suing New Jersey to try to overturn its law; but for now, at least, gambling on sporting events is permitted within state lines.

Nevada: Gambling on sporting events has been legal in Nevada since 1950 – long before most other forms of online gambling were even conceptualized. In fact, Nevada was essentially responsible for paving the way for modern-day online gaming when it passed legislation legalizing internet poker in 2013. As such, it’s no surprise that Las Vegas is home to some of the biggest and most popular sportsbooks in America.

Delaware: Delaware was actually one of the very first states to legalize online gambling back in 2009; so it should come as no surprise that the small northeastern state was also one of the first to legalize sports betting after Christie v. NCAA cleared the way last year. Delaware currently offers bets on NFL games only; but there are plans to expand into other sports soon.

West Virginia: West Virginia became the fourth state to legalize sports betting when Governor Jim Justice signed a bill into law in March 2018. The Mountaineers State joins Nevada and Delaware as one of only three states where you can bet on NFL games legally (although more are sure to follow). Like Delaware, West Virginia plans to eventually offer bets on other sporting events besides football.

Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania followed suit shortly after West Virginia by legalizing sports betting in April 2018 – just in time for MLB’s Opening Day. The Keystone State offers bets on a variety of sports including baseball, basketball, football, hockey and soccer; but as with most other states, bets are only placed through licensed casinos and racetracks at this point.

#  5 States Now Allow Sports Gambling In Poker Rooms 

All eyes are on the US Supreme Court as it decides if sports gambling is constitutional. The case being argued is Christie v NCAA, and it pits New Jersey against all other states in the country.

In preparation for a decision that could legalize sports betting across the US, five states have already taken it upon themselves to allow gambling in poker rooms.

 Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia all now permit some form of sports betting in establishments that offer poker.

West Virginia was the first state to act in anticipation of a favorable decision from the Supreme Court. On March 28th, they passed House Bill 4490 which allows “a person to make a wager on the outcome of any professional or collegiate sport, preseason NFL game, or any other game or event that uses skill and chance”.

Pennsylvania followed suit with Senate Bill 890 which was signed into law by Governor Tom Wolf on April 27th. This bill allows for parlay wagers (bets on multiple outcomes) and prop bets (bets on specific aspects of a game).

Nevada was the first state to legalize gambling way back in 1931 and they have been at the forefront of sports betting innovation ever since. In May of this year, they passed Assembly Bill 427 which allows for mobile sports betting within state lines. This bill also legalizes wagering on eSports matches.

New Jersey has been fighting for the legalization of sports gambling for years now and has seen a few defeats in the process. However, they have not given up and are still fighting hard for their cause. In June, Governor Phil Murphy signed Assembly Bill 4111 into law which authorizes casinos in Atlantic City to offer sports betting. This bill is much more limited than the one passed by West Virginia, as it only allows bets on NJ teams and does not include prop bets or parlay wagers.

Delaware was actually the first state to offer legalized sports betting after the Supreme Court agreed to hear Christie v NCAA. They did so by amending their existing law that allowed gambling in casinos and racetracks to include sportsbooks. This amendment went into effect on June 5th – just days after the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.

While these five states are leading the way in terms of legalizing sports gambling, there are sure to be many more that follow suit if SCOTUS decides in favor of New Jersey later this year.
