#  How do you win at golden dragon city? 

Golden Dragon City is an online casino game that can be played on your desktop or mobile device. The object of the game is to accumulate as many points as possible by winning pots. Players can bet anywhere from one to ten coins on each pot, and the size of the pot increases with every consecutive bet placed.

The game begins with three cards being dealt to each player. The player then has the option to either discard one card and draw another, or keep all three cards. After the player has made a decision, the dealer flips over the fourth card. If this card matches either of the player’s first two cards, the player automatically wins the pot. If it doesn’t match, then both players reveal their cards and the highest ranking hand wins the pot.

In addition to winning pots based on poker hands, there are also special bonus rounds that can be won. During these rounds, players are presented with a selection of dragons and they must choose one in order to win a prize. The prizes vary depending on which dragon is chosen, but typically include bonus coins and extra points.

So how do you go about winning at Golden Dragon City? Well, there are a few things you can do:

- Firstly, always bet the maximum number of coins possible in order to increase your chances of winning pots.
- Secondly, pay close attention to which dragons are being offered during the bonus rounds – some offer better prizes than others. 
- Finally, remember that practice makes perfect! The more you play, the better your odds of winning become.
