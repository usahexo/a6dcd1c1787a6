In the world of online casino gaming, there are countless titles to choose from. But for some players, there is one game that seems to stand out from all the rest - Viking Queen. This 5-reel slot game comes with stunning visuals and an engaging storyline, which is why it's no surprise that so many players find themselves drawn to it.

1) Set rules for yourself and stick to them

One of the best ways to manage your gambling habit is by setting rules for yourself and sticking to them. This means deciding how much money you're willing to spend on each game, how often you'll play, and what times of day are off limits. By creating a set of rules that you can stick to, you'll be less likely to overindulge in your favourite game.

2) Stay away from temptation

If you know that being in close proximity to your favourite casino game is going to lead to temptation, then it's best to stay away from it altogether. This might mean avoiding social media feeds that are filled with screenshots of people winning big or staying clear of physical casinos altogether. If you can't put distance between yourself and the temptation, it will be very difficult to overcome your cravings.

3) Find an alternative activity

If all else fails, try finding an alternative activity that can help take your mind off of gambling. This could be something as simple as reading a book, going for a walk or spending time with friends and family. By filling your spare time with other activities, you'll be less likely to turn to gambling as a way to pass the time.
