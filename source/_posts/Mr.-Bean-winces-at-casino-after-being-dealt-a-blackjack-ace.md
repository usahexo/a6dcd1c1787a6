#  Mr. Bean winces at casino after being dealt a blackjack ace

LAS VEGAS -- Mr. Bean was all smiles as he arrived at the casino, but his face quickly changed after being dealt a blackjack ace. 

"I'm not too sure about this," said Mr. Bean. "I think I'm going to have to go home." 

Despite being dealt an ace, Mr. Bean lost all of his money when he subsequently busted. 

"I really thought I had it this time," said Mr. Bean.

#  Atkinson stunned as casinos refuse to honour blackjack ace deal

British Labour MP Andy Atkinson was left stunned this week after three separate casinos refused to honour a blackjack deal he had struck where his first two cards were an ace and a two.

Under normal circumstances, the player would be offered a third card to try and improve their hand. However, in this instance the casinos all claimed that because Atkinson's two cards formed an 'automatic win' combination, they were not obliged to offer him any further cards.

"I simply couldn't believe it," said Atkinson. "I'd never heard of such a thing before."

The MP has now called for gambling legislation to be amended to prevent casinos from refusing to honour winning hands in this way.

"It's just not fair," he said. "These casinos are exploiting a loophole in the law and I'm determined to see it closed."

#  How to deal with a blackjack ace – Rowan Atkinson style

In one of his most memorable sketches, comedian Rowan Atkinson offers up some clever advice on how to deal with a blackjack ace. If you're ever in this situation, just remember Atkinson's tips and you'll be sure to come out on top.

1) Firstly, always remember that an ace is worth 1 point. This is an important rule to remember, especially when playing blackjack.

2) If you're dealt an ace and another card that is also worth 10 points (e.g. a jack, queen or king), then you have what's called a 'blackjack'. In this situation, you automatically win the game, no matter what the dealer has.

3) If you're not lucky enough to get a blackjack, but the ace is your first card, then you can choose to either 'hit' or 'stand'. If you hit, this means you take another card from the dealer in order to try and get closer to 21 points. If you stand, then you choose not to take any more cards and hope that the dealer goes bust (i.e. gets more than 21 points).

4) If the ace is your second card (or any other card), then it's important to remember that the ace can be used as either 1 point or 11 points. So if your total score is 16 points, for example, and you have an ace as your second card, then your total score becomes 17 (16 + 1 = 17).

5) Finally, always remember that the ace is a very powerful card and should be used wisely!

#  Rowan Atkinson's top tips for avoiding blackjack aces

Rowan Atkinson, the comedian and actor, is a keen blackjack player and has shared some of his top tips for avoiding being taken by a blackjack ace.

Firstly, Atkinson suggests always betting the same amount on each hand. This will help you to keep track of your progress and make it easier to work out when you should stop playing.

Second, he recommends avoiding splitting 16s as this is often where casinos make their profits. Splitting 16s may seem like a good idea but the odds are against you and you're more likely to lose money in the long run by doing so.

Thirdly, Atkinson advises not taking insurance no matter how tempting it may be. Insurance is essentially a bet against yourself and offers very poor odds, so it's best to avoid it altogether.

Finally, he recommends quitting while you're ahead. If you've been lucky enough to win a few hands in a row, it's best to walk away rather than risk losing your winnings. There's no point in trying to chase your losses – it's usually a recipe for disaster!

#  What to do if you're dealt a blackjack ace – from Mr. Bean himself!

There are a few different things you could do if you're dealt a blackjack ace, but the best option really depends on the situation. If you're playing at a table with other people, it might be best to stay in the game and see if you can get another card that will give you a better hand. If you're by yourself, though, it might be better to take your money and walk away.

No matter what you decide to do, though, make sure you know the basic blackjack strategy for playing with an ace. This way, you'll be able to make the best decision possible for your own game.
