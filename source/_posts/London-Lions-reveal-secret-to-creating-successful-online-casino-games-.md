#  The London Lions guide to building profitable online casino games 

Nearly every online casino these days offers a variety of online games. Naturally, the big ones with lots of traffic and revenue are the slots, followed by table games, video poker, and then other games.

What’s interesting is that the most popular games – slots – are also the most profitable for casino operators. In this article, we’re going to take a look at how you can build profitable online casino games.

# Choosing the right game 
Before you can begin designing your game, you first need to choose the right game to focus on. Slots are obviously a good choice as they’re popular and tend to have high margins for casinos. However, there are other games that can be profitable too if designed correctly.

Table games are generally less profitable than slots, but they have the potential to be more engaging for players. If you can come up with a unique table game that players haven’t seen before, it could be very successful.

Likewise, video poker is another option that can be profitable if done right. There are a lot of different variants of video poker, so make sure you choose one that’s popular and has a high RTP (return to player).

# Creating an engaging experience 
The key to making any game profitable is creating an engaging experience for players. This means designing a game that’s fun to play and has exciting features. Slots are generally more engaging than other types of casino games because they offer more excitement and interactivity.

Table games can be just as engaging as slots if designed correctly. Make sure all the tables are unlocked so players can switch between them easily. Also, include fun betting options like side bets and bonus rounds to keep players engaged.

Video poker is less engaging than slots or table games, but it can still be profitable if given enough attention. One way to make it more engaging is by adding unique bonus rounds that offer big payouts. You could also add special features that give players an edge over the house.

3. Keep things exciting

No one wants to play a dull game, so make sure to keep things exciting by adding new challenges and features on a regular basis. This will keep players coming back for more!

4. Set a fair price point

It’s important to set a fair price point for your casino games, as players will be less likely to purchase them if they’re too expensive. Make sure the price is reasonable and reflects the quality of your game.
