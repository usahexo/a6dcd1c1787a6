      Study Shows Americans Gamble $150 Billion a Year on Sports

        <h1 id="Study-Shows-Americans-Gamble-150-Billion-a-Year-on-Sports"><a href="#Study-Shows-Americans-Gamble-150-Billion-a-Year-on-Sports" class="headerlink" title="Study Shows Americans Gamble $150 Billion a Year on Sports"></a>Study Shows Americans Gamble $150 Billion a Year on Sports</h1><p>A new study from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has found that Americans gamble a whopping $150 billion dollars a year on sports. This number is made up of individual and team bets, as well as casino and online gambling.</p>
<p>The study also found that men are more likely to gamble than women, and that those who identify as Republicans are more likely to bet on sports than those who identify as Democrats. However, there was no significant difference in gambling habits between whites and non-whites.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the study also showed that people living in states where casino gambling is legal tend to bet more money on sports than those living in states without casinos. This may be because people in states with casinos feel more comfortable gambling and are therefore more likely to bet larger sums of money.</p>
<p>Experts say the findings of the study should not be taken as a cause for alarm, but instead viewed as an opportunity to educate people about the dangers of gambling. They advise those who do gamble to do so responsibly and only wager what they can afford to lose.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Gaming-Commission-Says-Gambling-on-Sports-is-a-4-Billion-Industry"><a href="#Nevada-Gaming-Commission-Says-Gambling-on-Sports-is-a-4-Billion-Industry" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Gaming Commission Says Gambling on Sports is a $4 Billion Industry"></a>Nevada Gaming Commission Says Gambling on Sports is a $4 Billion Industry</h1><p>In a statement released this week, the Nevada Gaming Commission said that gambling on sports is a $4 billion industry. This number is based on the amount of money that was wagered in Nevada casinos alone in 2016.</p>
<p>The commission also said that this number is likely to grow in 2017, as more states legalize gambling on sporting events. In fact, the commission estimates that the total amount of money wagered on sports will reach $10 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>This news comes as no surprise to casino operators in Nevada. Many of them have been preparing for this growth in the industry by increasing their betting limits and expanding their sports offerings.</p>
<p>Nevada is currently the only state where full-scale sports betting is legal. However, several other states are close to legalizing it, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.</p>
<p>This growth in the sports betting industry is good news for casino operators, but it could also mean trouble for bettors. With more states legalizing sports betting, it will become increasingly difficult to find favorable lines and odds at casinos.</p>
<h1 id="Report-More-Than-2-Billion-Bet-on-Super-Bowl-in-2017-Alone"><a href="#Report-More-Than-2-Billion-Bet-on-Super-Bowl-in-2017-Alone" class="headerlink" title="Report: More Than $2 Billion Bet on Super Bowl in 2017 Alone"></a>Report: More Than $2 Billion Bet on Super Bowl in 2017 Alone</h1><p>Americans wagered more than $2.4 billion on the Super Bowl in 2017, making it the biggest betting event in U.S. history.</p>
<p>The Nevada Gaming Control Board reports that nearly $138 million was wagered on the big game in its jurisdiction, while figures from offshore sportsbooks show nearly $2.3 billion was placed on the outcome of Super Bowl LI – smashing the record of $1.9 billion set just a year earlier.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Eagles’ upset victory over the New England Patriots is thought to have contributed to the increase, with heavy underdog odds and a thrilling finish causing some last-minute interest from bettors.</p>
<p>“No one had any idea who was going to win this game, which drove up betting action,” said Dave Mason, communications director for The Stars Group, which operates offshore sportsbook BetStars.</p>
<p>While Nevada cashed in on Super Bowl bets totaling $138 million, Delaware came second with a haul of $5.3 million despite having only 1 percent of Nevada’s population. That’s because Delaware offers single-game wagers on NFL games, not just the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, bookmakers suffered losses thanks to the Patriots’ dramatic comeback win. In the UK, William Hill reported taking £20 million in bets (about $27 million), but expected to lose £10 million as a result (almost $14 million).</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Sports-Book-Takes-In-Record-44-Million-in-2016"><a href="#Delaware-Sports-Book-Takes-In-Record-44-Million-in-2016" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Sports Book Takes In Record $44 Million in 2016"></a>Delaware Sports Book Takes In Record $44 Million in 2016</h1><p>Despite the sluggish economy and tighter purse strings, Delawareans plunked down a record $44 million at the state’s sports books in 2016.</p>
<p>That eclipses the previous high of $40 million set in 2015.</p>
<p>The sharp increase is attributable to more people placing bets, as well as higher payouts on winning tickets. In all, nearly 2.9 million transactions were processed last year, up from 2.7 million in 2015.</p>
<p>“Delawareans are enthusiastic about gambling on sporting events,” said Vaughn Stitto, director of the state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement. “Not only is this activity growing, but we’re also seeing an increase in the amount wagered per transaction.”</p>
<p>Most of Delaware’s sports betting action takes place at three racinos - Delaware Park, Harrington Raceway &amp; Casino, and Dover Downs Hotel &amp; Casino - which offer both slot machines and table games. The state also has two off-track betting parlors - Sussex Downs and Baywood Greens - as well as a casino in Ocean City, Md.</p>
<p>Since 2009, when sports betting was legalized in Delaware, residents have wagered more than $1 billion on sporting events.</p>
<h1 id="U-S-Gambling-on-Sports-Could-Reach-220-Billion-by-2020"><a href="#U-S-Gambling-on-Sports-Could-Reach-220-Billion-by-2020" class="headerlink" title="U.S. Gambling on Sports Could Reach $220 Billion by 2020"></a>U.S. Gambling on Sports Could Reach $220 Billion by 2020</h1><p>A new study by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gs.com/">research firm Goldman Sachs</a> suggests that the amount of money wagered on sports in the United States could reach as high as $220 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>This figure is more than three times the estimated $67.4 billion that was bet on sports in the country in 2016.</p>
<p>According to the report, the growth in gambling on sports will be driven largely by increasing interest in legalized gambling, especially in states that have recently approved it (e.g., New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia).</p>
<p><em>“We continue to see a large opportunity for growth as legal gambling expands beyond Nevada and New Jersey to other states,” said analysts Matthew Jacobson and Michael Nathanson.</em></p>
<p>The expansion of legalized gambling is also being helped along by technological advances such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/02/can-mobile-betting-save-the-u-s-sports-gambling-market/">mobile betting</a>.</p>
<p> In addition, there is expected to be increased interest in betting on sports due to the competitive nature of major professional leagues such as the NBA and NFL.</p>
<p>The report from Goldman Sachs is not all good news for the gambling industry, however. It notes that there is a risk that regulatory changes or problems with operators could slow down growth.</p>
