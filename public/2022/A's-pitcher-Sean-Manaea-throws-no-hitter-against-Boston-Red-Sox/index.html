        <h1 id="A’s-pitcher-Sean-Manaea-throws-no-hitter-against-Boston-Red-Sox"><a href="#A’s-pitcher-Sean-Manaea-throws-no-hitter-against-Boston-Red-Sox" class="headerlink" title="A’s pitcher Sean Manaea throws no-hitter against Boston Red Sox"></a>A’s pitcher Sean Manaea throws no-hitter against Boston Red Sox</h1><p>The Oakland Athletics’ Sean Manaea pitched a no-hitter against the Boston Red Sox on Saturday, the first ever thrown by an A’s pitcher against the Red Sox. The no-hitter was the 26-year-old Manaea’s third in just his 73rd major league start.</p>
<p>Manaea started out strong, striking out six of the first nine batters he faced. He walked Jackie Bradley Jr. in the fourth inning and Mookie Betts in the seventh, but both were left stranded. In the ninth inning, he got Xander Bogaerts to ground into a double play to close out the game and secure his place in history.</p>
<p>“It feels amazing,” said Manaea after the game. “It was a really close game and I had to battle through it. Once I got past those two guys [in the ninth inning], I knew it was over.”</p>
<p>Manaea’s no-hitter was only the fifth thrown in American League history and comes less than two weeks after Red Sox pitcher Chris Sale tossed his own no-hitter against the Tampa Bay Rays. It was also only the second time that two no-hitters have been thrown in consecutive games in MLB history; the last time was when Seattle Mariners’ Chris Bosio no-hit Boston on April 22, 1993, and Toronto Blue Jays’ Dave Stewart did likewise on May 13, 1993.</p>
<h1 id="Oakland-Athletics-win-consecutive-games-for-the-first-time-this-season"><a href="#Oakland-Athletics-win-consecutive-games-for-the-first-time-this-season" class="headerlink" title="Oakland Athletics win consecutive games for the first time this season"></a>Oakland Athletics win consecutive games for the first time this season</h1><p>The Oakland Athletics won consecutive games for the first time this season over the weekend. On Friday night, they defeated the Texas Rangers 7-3, and then on Saturday they beat the Detroit Tigers 11-4. This was only their fourth and fifth wins of the season, so it was a much needed boost for the team.</p>
<p>One reason for their recent success is that they are starting to get some key players back from injury. Khris Davis, who leads the team in home runs, returned to the lineup on Friday after missing a few games. Stephen Piscotty, who has also been struggling with injuries, played in both games over the weekend and hit a home run on Saturday.</p>
<p>The A’s will look to keep winning as they head into a tough stretch of their schedule. They have 10 games against teams that are currently above .500 in their next 14 games. But if they can continue to play well and get some key players back from injury, they could make a push for a playoff spot late in the season.</p>
<h1 id="Khris-Davis-hits-2-home-runs-including-game-winner-in-extra-innings-against-Seattle-Mariners"><a href="#Khris-Davis-hits-2-home-runs-including-game-winner-in-extra-innings-against-Seattle-Mariners" class="headerlink" title="Khris Davis hits 2 home runs, including game-winner in extra innings against Seattle Mariners"></a>Khris Davis hits 2 home runs, including game-winner in extra innings against Seattle Mariners</h1><p>The Oakland Athletics battled to a 6-5 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Tuesday night, with Khris Davis doing most of the damage. Davis hit a solo home run in the first inning, and then belted a game-winning two-run homer in the 10th inning. He finished the game with three RBIs.</p>
<p>Davis has been on a tear lately, hitting seven home runs in his last six games. This latest outburst gives him 27 homers on the season, putting him in a tie for third place in the American League.</p>
<p>“It feels good,” Davis said of his recent hot streak. “I’m just trying to see the ball well and put a good swing on it.”</p>
<p>The Athletics have now won six of their last seven games, putting them within striking distance of the second wild card spot in the AL. They will look to keep things going when they take on the Mariners again on Wednesday night.</p>
<h1 id="A’s-outfielder-Matt-Joyce-makes-great-catch-against-wall-in-center-field"><a href="#A’s-outfielder-Matt-Joyce-makes-great-catch-against-wall-in-center-field" class="headerlink" title="A’s outfielder Matt Joyce makes great catch against wall in center field"></a>A’s outfielder Matt Joyce makes great catch against wall in center field</h1><p>The Oakland Athletics hosted the Texas Rangers on Saturday night where they secured an 8-3 victory. One of the highlights of the game was when A’s outfielder Matt Joyce made a great catch against the wall in center field.</p>
<p>With the Rangers batting in the top of the fourth inning, and runners on first and second base, Joey Gallo hit a deep fly ball to center field. Joyce raced towards the ball and made an incredible leaping catch at the wall to take away an extra-base hit from Gallo.</p>
<p>Joyce’s teammates were quick to celebrate his spectacular play, as was A’s manager Bob Melvin. “That was an outstanding play,” Melvin said after the game. “For him to go back on that ball and make that play is pretty impressive.”</p>
<p>It is not often that a player can rob someone of an extra-base hit by making a leaping catch at the wall, but that is exactly what Joyce did on Saturday night. He has now made five outfield assists this season, which ranks second in the American League.</p>
<p>The A’s will continue their series with the Rangers on Sunday afternoon, and they will be looking to extend their winning streak to four games.</p>
<h1 id="Oakland-Athletics-scoring-just-enough-to-win-ballgames"><a href="#Oakland-Athletics-scoring-just-enough-to-win-ballgames" class="headerlink" title="Oakland Athletics scoring just enough to win ballgames"></a>Oakland Athletics scoring just enough to win ballgames</h1><p>The Oakland Athletics have been one of the more surprising teams in baseball this season. Heading into the All-Star break, they sit just two games below .500 and are only four games out of a wild card spot. While their offense has not been as prolific as some others in the league, they have been scoring just enough runs to win ballgames.</p>
<p>The A’s are led offensively by Khris Davis, who is batting .247 with 22 homers and 59 RBIs. Jed Lowrie is also having a good year, batting .288 with 12 homers and 50 RBIs. But it has been their pitching that has carried them most of the season.</p>
<p>Starting pitchers Sean Manaea, Brett Anderson, and Trevor Cahill have all pitched well this year. The bullpen has also been strong, led by Lou Trivino, who has 8 saves and a 1.50 ERA.</p>
<p>If the A’s can continue to pitch well and score just enough runs to win ballgames, they have a good chance of making the playoffs this season.</p>
