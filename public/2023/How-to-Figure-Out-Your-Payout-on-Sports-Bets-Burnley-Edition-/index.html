In this article, we’re going to break down how to do just that by using Burnley as an example. </p>
<p>So, let’s say that you bet £10 on Burnley-Watford and Burnley wins 2-1. What would your payout be? </p>
<p>Well, your initial bet was £10, so your payout would be £20 (your original bet plus the winnings). </p>
<p>However, if Watford had won instead, your payout would have been £0 because you would have lost your initial £10 bet. </p>
<p>It’s important to note that bookmakers often have different payout rates for each match, so it’s worth doing a bit of research before placing any bets. </p>
<p>But overall, this is a pretty basic formula for calculating your payouts on sports bets.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Calculate-Bet-Payouts-for-Football-Matches-Burnley-Edition"><a href="#How-to-Calculate-Bet-Payouts-for-Football-Matches-Burnley-Edition" class="headerlink" title="How to Calculate Bet Payouts for Football Matches: Burnley Edition"></a>How to Calculate Bet Payouts for Football Matches: Burnley Edition</h1><p>When betting on football matches, it’s important to know how your payout is calculated. This article will take you through the process of how to calculate bet payouts for a match between Burnley and Manchester City, using the example of a £10 bet.</p>
<p>Firstly, we need to work out the odds for the two teams. This can be done by looking at past results and form, as well as other factors such as injuries and suspensions. In this case, let’s say that Burnley are listed at odds of 10/1 and Manchester City are 1/10.</p>
<p>Now we need to calculate how much we would win if we placed a £10 bet on Burnley. This is simply (odds x amount wagered). So in this case, it would be (10/1 x 10) = £100.</p>
<p>Next, we need to calculate our potential payout if Manchester City win. This is done by multiplying the odds by the amount wagered, then subtracting the original bet. So in this case it would be (1/10 x 10) - 10 = £-1.</p>
<p>This means that our total payout for a £10 bet on Burnley would be £100, while our total payout for a £10 bet on Manchester City would be £-1.</p>
<h1 id="Burnley’s-Guide-to-Calculating-Sporting-Bet-Payouts"><a href="#Burnley’s-Guide-to-Calculating-Sporting-Bet-Payouts" class="headerlink" title="Burnley’s Guide to Calculating Sporting Bet Payouts"></a>Burnley’s Guide to Calculating Sporting Bet Payouts</h1><p>In this article we’re going to take a look at how Burnley calculates sporting bet payouts.<br>This process is important for bookmakers as it allows them to accurately price up bets and ensure that they make a profit on any wagers placed. </p>
<p>Let’s start with a simple example. Say we have a football match between Liverpool and Everton, and we want to place a bet on the final outcome. In order to calculate the payout, Burnley would first work out the odds of each team winning.<br>Liverpool are odds-on favourites at 2/7, while Everton are 5/1 outsiders. This means that for every £7 wagered on Liverpool winning, the bookmaker would only pay out £2 profit (less their commission of course).<br>On the other hand, for every £1 wagered on Everton winning, the bookmaker would pay out £5 plus their commission.</p>
<p>Now let’s say that instead of betting on the outright winner, we wanted to bet on who would win the first goal. In this case, the odds would be different as both teams have an equal chance of scoring first.<br>If we wanted to place a £10 bet on this market, Burnley would calculate that it would be split into two bets - one for Liverpool to score first and one for Everton to score first. Each wager would then have its own set of odds.<br>For Liverpool to score first, the odds would be 11/10, while for Everton to score first they would be 9/4. This means that if Liverpool scored first, our £10 bet would net us £11 in winnings (plus our original stake back), while if Everton scored first our £10 bet would net us £13 in winnings (plus our original stake back).</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Calculate-Winnings-from-Your-Sports-Bets-Burnley-Edition"><a href="#How-to-Calculate-Winnings-from-Your-Sports-Bets-Burnley-Edition" class="headerlink" title="How to Calculate Winnings from Your Sports Bets: Burnley Edition"></a>How to Calculate Winnings from Your Sports Bets: Burnley Edition</h1><p>Although Burnley may seem like a small team, they actually have a good chance of winning against teams like Manchester City. In this article, we’ll show you how to calculate your winnings from your sports bets so that you can make the most money possible.</p>
<p>We’ll use the following example to demonstrate how to calculate your winnings: </p>
<p>If you bet £10 on Burnley to win and they do in fact win, your total winnings would be £30 (your original bet plus the £20 profit).</p>
<p>To calculate your total winnings, we first need to figure out how much money you stand to gain if Burnley wins. This is simply your original bet multiplied by the odds of them winning. In our example, this would be £10 multiplied by 3/1, which equals £30.</p>
<p>Now that we know how much money we can win if Burnley wins, we need to subtract our original bet from this amount. This gives us our profit, which in our example would be £20 (£30 minus £10).<br>Bets can often be placed in fractions or decimals depending on where you are placing them. Sometimes bookmakers will also offer different odds on different parts of a game. If this is the case, it’s important to use the correct odds when calculating your potential profits.<br>  So now you know how to calculate your potential profits for any given sports bet- not just those involving Burnley! Keep this information in mind next time you’re placing a wager and see if you can’t walk away with some extra cash in your pocket.</p>
<h1 id="Determining-Sports-Bet-Payouts-The-Burnley-Way"><a href="#Determining-Sports-Bet-Payouts-The-Burnley-Way" class="headerlink" title="Determining Sports Bet Payouts: The Burnley Way"></a>Determining Sports Bet Payouts: The Burnley Way</h1><p>When Burnley FC faced Brighton and Hove Albion in the Premier League in May of 2018, they were the favorites to win. The odds were set at 2/9 for Burnley, while Brighton was at 13/2. So when Burnley did win 3-1, their payout for a $100 bet would have been $73.85 - a pretty decent return on investment.</p>
<p>But how do bookmakers come up with those payout numbers? It’s not as simple as flipping a coin - there’s a lot of math and analysis that goes into it. In this article, we’ll take a look at the process that bookmakers use to determine payouts, and see how Burnley’s win over Brighton fit into it.</p>
<p>First let’s start with the basics: what is a bookmaker? A bookmaker (or bookie) is someone who takes bets on sporting events. They act as the middleman between the gambler and the event itself, accepting bets and then paying out winnings. They make their money by taking a commission on all bets placed - typically around 10%.</p>
<p>So how do they come up with those payouts? The first step is to set odds for each outcome of the event. Odds can be expressed in a number of ways - fractional, decimal or American - but they all mean the same thing: the likelihood of that outcome happening. So in our Burnley vs Brighton example, 2/9 means that Burnley is twice as likely to win as Brighton is. 13/2 means that Brighton is six times more likely to lose than Burnley is to win.</p>
<p>Once the odds are set, the bookmaker has to figure out how much they’re going to pay out if someone bets on each outcome. This payout will be different for every bet, depending on how much money is being wagered and what the odds are. So if someone bets $10 on Burnley to win and they do indeed win, the bookmaker will payout $10 plus their commission (typically $1). If someone bets $10 on Brighton to lose, however, they would get paid $130 ($10 plus the $120 in commission).</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at how Burnley’s 3-1 victory over Brighton played into all this. Since Burnley was the favorite going into the match, their odds were lower than Brighton’s. This means that if you had bet $10 on them winning, you would have only gotten back $8.89 (plus commission) instead of the usual $10 payout. But because Brighton lost by such a wide margin, their odds skyrocketed from 13/2 to 40/1 - meaning that if you had put money on them losing, you would have gotten paid out big time!</p>
